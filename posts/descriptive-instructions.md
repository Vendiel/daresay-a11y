## Description

Write the copy so all users can make sense of it by using more than one sensory characteristics (shape, color, size, visual location, orientation, sound).

Example:

- Instead of "To submit the form, press the button below", write "To submit the form, press the round button labeled Go".
- Instead of "Press the green button to proceed to the next step", write "Press the green button labeled Go to proceed to the next step."
