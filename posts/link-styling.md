## Description

Color alone is not sufficient to indicate the presence of a link, additional cues like underline, bigger font, another font, bold, etc must be used.

It can be okay to use only color for links if the contrast ratio between the link and the surrounding text is at least 3:1 (both text colors must also meet the 4.5:1 contrast reqsuirement against the background). However it's important that additional cues like underline, bold, bigger font size etc are used for hover and focus of the links.
