## Description

By adding what input purpose different controls have, information about the user (name, address, phone number, etc) can be automatically filled in by auto-fill in browser or additional helpful elements can be added automatically to make it easier for users to understand the purpose of the field (like a phone icon for a phone number field).

This makes it easier for people with motor impairments or cognitive disabilities to fill in forms more quickly, easily and accurately.

Pre-defined input purposes that can be used: https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#input-purposes
