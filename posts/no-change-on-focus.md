## Description

When a control receives focus it shall not result in a substantial change of context that disorients the users. All changes of context should be triggered by user action.

## Examples

- A form thatâ€™s automatically submitted when the submit button receives focus.
- A new window is launched when a link receives focus.
- Focus gets automatically moved to another control.

## Additional information

Showing additional things on hover, like a tooltip or a drop down menu is okay. These things are not changing the context (moving focus away to another place).
