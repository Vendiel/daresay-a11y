## Examples

For example, search button that only holds a magnifying lens should have an alt text that states "Search", not "Magnifying glass". A printer icon should state "Print this page" instead "image of printer". A clickable logo should state where you end up, e.g. "Daresay home" or "Daresay homepage".
