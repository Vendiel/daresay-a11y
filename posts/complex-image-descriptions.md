## Description

Make sure that complex images, like infographics, charts, diagrams, graphs and maps, have an alt attribute and a long description in nearby text.

Can be done in different ways.

- If the image is described in adjacent text, write in alt text under which section the information can be found.
- Create a separate page with the information that is linked from an adjacent image text.
- aria-describedby can be used for text-only information.
