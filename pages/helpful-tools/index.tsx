            <h1>Helpful tools</h1>
            <p>
              There are many different kinds of accessibility tools that can help you out when creating a
              digital product or service. Here we've added a few tips here but since new tools always enters
              the market we recommend that you take a look around.

          <h2>Screen readers</h2>
          <p>
            Navigate your product with a screen reader to ensure that even if the user can't see your
            interface they still get an equally understandable experience with a screen reader. There are
            different screen readers on the market - some are free and some are not - and they differ when it
            comes to functionality and support.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are building an Android or iOS app we recommend you to use Androids and iOS own build-in
            screen readers - TalkBack and VoiceOver. You find them in the settings menu. Please note that it
            might take some time getting use to.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you need to test on a computer you can try out VoiceOver on Mac OSX or NVDA - NonVisual Desktop
            Access . If you're building a website and you can access it on your phone, you can of course use
            TalkBack or VoiceOver on your Android or iOS phone too.

          <h2>Tabbing through the UI</h2>
          <p>
            Always try out navigating your product using only your keyboard. The basics of keyboard testing is
            simple â€” make sure you can navigate to every interactive control using the Tab key and then use
            enter, (sometimes spacebar) to select an element and the arrow keys for in control navigation. If
            you're interested you can learn more about{" "}

            to get a visual indication and order of your tab order (found under their Ad hoc tools).
          </p>
          <p>
            While testing this out, make sure that every interactive control that gets focus has a visble
            focus state that fulfills contrast requirements.

            motor skills. These tools might not be something you use on a daily basis when designing,
            implementing or testing our your products but they can be helpful to use when making decision

            Some people with limited vision use magnifying glass to zoom in on different parts of the screen.
