              Accessibility (a11y) is the practice of making your digital service, experience and information
              understandable and usable for everyone. It's also about treating everyone the same, giving
              everyone equal opportunity, no matter ability or circumstances.

              At Daresay we incorporate this mindset in everything we do and by sharing this checklist with
              you, we hope to make it easier for other to do it as well.

                The checklist is good to use before, during and after the design phase or development phase.
                It's dividing it into the different elements you use when creating an online experience.
